### Reminders for pull request authors

- If this pull request represents feature work and there isn't already an issue, then please create one, and make sure to read "Reminders for issue authors" from that template
- You should merge your own pull request only after colleagues on other teams have had sufficient time to review it and you have at least one cross-team approval. The pace of template development is typically slower than project work, so it is reasonable to leave a PR up for 10 days to allow for feedback.
- If your pull request is particularly large, consequential, or complex, it is worthwhile to seek out one or more additional reviews

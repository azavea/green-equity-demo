### Reminders for issue authors

- Please seek out input from affected teams before undertaking major and/or architectural changes
- For small or low-impact changes, opening an issue may be all that's required, but for larger changes, a group discussion may be helpful to gain buy-in
- New features should be compatible with extant uses of the template. If uses diverge, newer features should allow for a well-documented, incremental path to adoption
    - e.g., new projects can adopt Typescript incrementally by changing file extensions piecemeal from `.js(x)` to `.ts(x)`. They are also free to remove or ignore Typescript files and dependencies.
